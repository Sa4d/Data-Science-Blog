## Project Motivation 
I used Stack Overflow suvery data from 2017, and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data) on kaggle feel free to check it 
I was interesting to find the following answers: 

1.How many countries, and which top 10 countries had the most respondent?

2.What is the most programing lanuage is used?

3.What Location Have The highest Salary?

lastly since I'm from saudi arabia, I wanted to take a look around the Saudi Arabia Data

4.A look To Saudi Arabia Data and insights
